This simple application was created in [R](href="http://www.r-project.org) with the
[Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny) framework. The app tests the Shiny framework for building interactive 
web application from within RStudio, using temperature related data from several Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) 
weather stations.
